cmdscript is one of the most useful scripting plugins in roblox, in its use it could be flexible : manageable, and fluent. With its use of the regular studio script editor, you are

There are also bulitin functions like run to run scripts, or req to require a module by its source, and mouse to get a MouseInstance.
